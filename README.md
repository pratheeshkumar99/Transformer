# Transformer Model for Neural Machine Translation

## Description
This project implements a Transformer model designed for translating text from English to Kannada, based on the architecture proposed in the "Attention is All You Need" paper. The implementation utilizes PyTorch, along with Hugging Face's `datasets` and `tokenizers` libraries, to create a robust and efficient translation system suitable for the specific linguistic features of the Kannada language.
